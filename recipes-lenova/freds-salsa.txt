FRED'S SALSA RECIPE
7 cups peeled and seeded tomatoes
(I don't peel or seed my tomatoes any more and nobody notices)
6 green onions sliced and diced
2 jalapeno peppers diced
4 cloves garlic, minced ( I sometime take it right of the jar, 3 tablespoons, but fresh is better)
2 or 3 green peppers sliced and diced (This is my special choice)
2 tablespoons minced cilantro
2 teaspoons salt
1/2 cup vinegar (5% acidity)
4 drops hot pepper sauce ( I use anyone I have )
I sometimes add fresh zucchini or summer squash if it is in season, just for the color.
Prepare home canning jars and lids according to manufacturer’s instructions.
(In other words clean and boils before using,) Use new covers and lids each time.
Combine all ingredients in a LARGE saucepot. Bring mixture to a boil, (about 10 minutes worth) 
then reduce heat and simmer 15 minutes. Carefully ladle hot salsa into hot jars, leaving ¼” 
headspace. Wipe rim and threads of jars with a damp clean cloth. Place lid on jar with sealing 
compound next to glass. Screw band down evenly and firmly. Do not use excessive force. 
Process 15 minutes in a boiling-water canner.
Yield: About 5 pints
Note: When seeding and cutting hot peppers, wear rubber gloves to prevent your hands , eyes, or 
wherever, from being burned.
THIS IS A MILD SALSA RECIPE. If you want to spice it up, do so at your own risk. You will 
lose the taste of the fresh vegetables if you are not careful.
